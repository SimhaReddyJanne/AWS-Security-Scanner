# AWS-Security-Scanner
An automated security audit tool that scans IAM users and S3 bucket configurations for security risks. It lists IAM users, detects those without MFA, retrieves S3 buckets, and identifies public ones. Results are stored in S3. Built using AWS Lambda, Python (Boto3), and IAM Policies to enhance cloud security automation.
